NEW COMMANDS AVAILABLE
================================================================================

Standard Build:
    $ npm run build
    Creates minified production build in /dist

Build with SEO:
    $ npm run build:seo
    Builds with full SEO validation

TEST SERVER (NEW):
    $ npm run test
    Starts test server on http://localhost:8080
    Serves minified build from /dist
    Press CTRL+C to stop

Complete Deployment:
    $ npm run deploy
    Build + SEO + Git + Push (all in one)

Quick Workflow (NEW):
    $ npm run build && npm run test
    Build then test in one command

================================================================================
QUICK START GUIDE
================================================================================

For First-Time Use:

    Step 1: Build
        $ npm run build
        (creates /dist with minified files)

    Step 2: Test
        $ npm run test
        (starts server on http://localhost:8080)

    Step 3: Browser
        Open http://localhost:8080
        Run through testing checklist

    Step 4: Stop
        Press CTRL+C

    Step 5: Deploy (if tests pass)
        $ npm run deploy
        (validates SEO, builds, commits, pushes)

Complete Workflow:

    $ npm run build          # Minify
    $ npm run test           # Test locally
    [test in browser]
    [CTRL+C to stop]
    $ git add .              # Stage changes
    $ git commit -m "msg"    # Commit
    $ npm run deploy         # Deploy (with SEO validation)
    
    Result: Site live in ~2 minutes

    → Verify in browser → npm run deploy
    Can test exact production build before deployment
    Reduced risk of issues
    Structured testing workflow
    Complete testing documentation
